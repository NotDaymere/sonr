It made us feel like we lived in the future.Today, software is everywhere. But truly great software has become incredibly rare. Computers are faster, but apps work slower. Craftsmanship has been replaced with growth hacks. Visionary product ideas turned into incremental changes.The magic of software got lost along the way. At Linear, we are on a quest to bring it back.</div>
                        <div>We are building the tools for the next generation of high-impact companies. The place where ambitious creators come to bring radical ideas to life. Our mission is to empower the world's best product and engineering teams to do their best work. To build products that feel magical again.</div>
